      I am currently in the first year at BYUI studying computer and web programming.
     I am excited and looking forward to all the cool things I can build with the knowledge I gain from this course.
      I am hoping to learn and interact with all of you.

      My sister and mum are members of the church but I am an atheist. However I do enjoy attending services just to sing the hymns. I love hymns. My favorite is "The Day Dawn Is Breaking"
